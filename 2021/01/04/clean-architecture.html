<ul>
  <li>A function should do one and only one thing (and – as a rule of thumb –  be no longer than 50 lines of code).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="single-responsibility-principle">Single-responsibility principle</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A module (usually source file) should only have one reason to change – it should be responsible to a single actor that can demand changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Example: an employee class that produces outputs for the finance and HR departments violates the principle, as both the CFO and the CHO might demand changes that then unintenionally affects the output seen by the other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Solution: Separate code that different actors depend on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Corollary: don’t reuse a function for two different outputs because it does the same thing, but because it does the same thing is used in all instances for outputs used by the same actor. (Above, the CFO might want to tweak how regular hours are calculated. If the same function is used for HR, this will affect the calculations that HR gets.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
