# Ignoring files

- Use repo-specific `.gitignore` files to exclude unneeded files that are
  created (and recreated) during the build-process of that repo. Everything
  else (like files generated by my system, IDE, etc.) that don't belog in the
  repo are handled by my global `.gitignore_global` file, which is located in my home
  directory. To tell Git where it is, use `$git config --global core.excludefile
  ~/.gitignore_global`.

- [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) let's you
  select all languages used in a project and creates a good `.gitignore` file
  that takes care of them all. Use this for projects. Alternatively,
  [GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore) provides language specific
  ignore templates.

- To ignore a file that is already checked in, untrack the file before setting a
  rule to ignore it. To untrack, use `$ git rm --cached FILENAME`.

- For ignore rules, check
  [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring)
  section in the Pro Git book and [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) one
  in the man pages.


# Workflow

- Create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for each task.

- Close issues automatically by mentioning their number in the pull request that completes the
    task.

- Using `gh pr create --fill` from a topic branch that I want to merge
    automatically creates a pull request to main with the branch name as the
    title and all the commits to the branch as the body. Using commit messages
    meaningful and linking issues (I'm gonna use `Fixes #<number>` as a
    convention) makes this a super convenient way to track changes to the main
    branch in a transparent way.

- So, when I work on a new feature or issue, I create a branch with a meaningful
    name, write meaningful commits, add `Fixes #<number>` to the final commit,
    and then use `gh pr create --fill` and `gh pr merge` to create a pull
    request an merge it.



# CLI

- Use the [CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/) to manage GitHub from the
    command line.

- Use the CLIs aliasing capability instead of defining aliases in my `.bashrc`.
    Type `gh help alias set` for help on how to set aliases, and `gh help alias`
    for help on aliasing functionality.
