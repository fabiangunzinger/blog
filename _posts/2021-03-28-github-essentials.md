# Workflow



- Create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for each task.
- Close issues automatically by mentioning their number in the pull request that completes the
    task.



# CLI

- Use the [CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/) to manage GitHub from the
    command line.

- Use the CLIs aliasing capability instead of defining aliases in my `.bashrc`.
    Type `gh help alias set` for help on how to set aliases, and `gh help alias`
    for help on aliasing functionality.
