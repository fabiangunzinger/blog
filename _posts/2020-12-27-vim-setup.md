# My (n)vim setup

Mostly for my future self, this post documents the main choices I made when
setting up vim.

## Use Neovim

- I use neovim rather than vim because it seems to be
    the future; it's open source, uses lua rather than vim-script, and is used
    by [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7TAX653_OM&t=549s) I implicitly trust. From browsing on the web, it seems like many people are contemplating switching over, and as someone who's just starting out, it seems like there is no good reason to carefully set up vim with an expectation to switch in the future.

## `YouCompleteMe` for code completion

[Often](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe/wiki/FAQ#ycm-does-not-work-with-my-anaconda-python-setup)
doesn't work with Anaconda Python, and I seem to be one of those cases. Followed
the suggestion in the link.
- I first tried compiling with `/usr/bin/python3`, but this didn't work.
- I then tried `/usr/local/bin/python3.9`, following
    [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62546912/youcompleteme-completed-failed), which seems to have worked.
