# Sharing code between projects


## The mission

There is a lot of code I reuse across all my projects. I want to turn all these
code snippets into building blocks that I mantain in a single place and that I
can share across projects.


## Options


### Private Python Package

Advantages:

- Relatively simple

Disadvantages:

- Need to worry about versioning

- Upgrading client repos for new changes could be tedious


## Monorepo


### Git submodules

Advantages:

Disadvantages:

- Complicated

- Only seem to work on master branch
